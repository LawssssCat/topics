Broken code can be a nightmare, but there are lots of tools to help us debug our Javascript issues, many built into the browser.

## Browser developer tools

### Console error log

### Commenting out pieces of code

### Using console.log

Often we need to debug code and write out our variables to see what’s inside them. Most modern browsers include a console a logging mechanism.

```js
var planet = 'Uranus',
  planets = ['Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Neptune']
;

// console.log() will write out the contents of a variable
//   into a special browser window panel called the console
console.log(planet); // Uranus
console.log(planets); // [Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune]
```
