A few small rules for communicating with teammates while working on software & design projects.

---

## Prefer asynchronous communication

*Multi-tasking doesn’t actually work well.*

Fully dedicating to a task will produce better & faster results.

Async communication prevents interruptions for dedicated tasks.

## Wisely use face-to-face time

*Write an Issue or it won’t get done.*

Decisions shouldn’t be made in person—people need time to think.

Tasks shouldn’t be assigned in person—people will forget.

Reserve face-to-face communication for engaging with people: brainstorming, personal feedback, etc.

## Nobody gets fired for opening an Issue

*Issue or it doesn’t exist.*

- Have a question? Open an Issue.
- Have an idea? Open an Issue.
- Something wonky? Open an Issue.

Issues are cheap, easy, permanent, searchable & linkable.

## Be mindful of noise

*Too many notifications is distracting.*

Contribute to Issues you can make in impact on—avoid drive-by comments.

Only comment if you have something to add—use “reactions” for support.

Always provide context in Issues, Pull requests & Commits: “A few edits” isn’t enough information.

## Use checklists to make blockers explicit

*Being obvious is always better.*

If an Issue is blocked, use todo lists to mention the reasons—and whom.

## Issues are organization-wide todos

*Don’t close an Issue until it’s resolved.*

Issues are a task that needs to be completed or a placeholder for a task.

Make Issues active: use a verb in the title.

Long-lasting Issues are completely okay if they still need to be completed.

## Keep discussions logically distinct

*Don’t dump everything into a single Issue.*

Keep Issues as focused as possible—one single purpose.

If a concern enters the Issue’s discussion that’s not directly related, open a new Issue and guide people there.

## If it has a URL, link to it

*It’s your obligation to find the URL.*

People are busy, they shouldn’t have to dig around for the URL of the thing you’re talking about.

## Make changes with pull requests

*Pull request or it won’t get changed.*

Everything should be reviewed by a peer before entering the `master` branch.

Create a pull request *early* to get feedback right away.

Pull requests are team property: the code isn’t *yours* it’s everybody’s to make better.

## Be professional

*Polite, courteous, honest.*

- Use well constructed sentences
- Remind people gently
- Don’t ping, just ask politely
- Overcompensate for tone
- Be human
