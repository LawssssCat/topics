Web browsers—complex multi-part pieces of software—are one of the major pieces that make up the backbone of the Internet.

## Browsers

Web browsers are primarily two components: the interface and the rendering engine. Both interfaces and rendering engines can closed source or open source. There’s lots of sharing that goes on. Web browsers are a big convoluted mess.

The *interface* is the piece that you interact with: the URL bar, the back button, the clicking, the scrolling—the window.

The *rendering engine* is a big program that takes all the website’s code and turns it into the thing you can see and use.

### Browser interfaces

There are countless browser interfaces, some shared between other browsers. Some of them are <dfn><abbr>OSS</abbr> (Open Source Software)</dfn> and some of them are closed-source. Here’s a few popular ones:

- **Chromium** — Chrome (big & small), Opera (big & small).
- **Firefox** — big screen & small screen versions.
- **Edge** — Microsoft’s newest browser for big & small screens.
- **Internet Explorer** — big screen & small screen versions.
- **Safari** — big screen & small screen versions.

### Rendering engines

When it comes to rendering engines there’s a few big players that are shared by most browsers on the web.

- **[Webkit](https://www.webkit.org/)** — open source; used in Safari, BlackBerry, Android, Symbian, UC Browser, and many many more.
- **[Blink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_%28layout_engine%29)** — open source, forked from Webkit; used in Chrome & Opera.
- **[Gecko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecko_%28software%29)** — open source; used in Firefox & Firefox Mobile.
- **[EdgeHTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdgeHTML)** — closed source; used in Microsoft Edge.
- **[Trident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trident_%28layout_engine%29)** — closed source; used in Internet Explorer.
- **[Presto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presto_%28layout_engine%29)** — closed source; Opera Mini, (used to power Opera too).

*Web browsers are a big—beautiful—mess of different forks, of shared engines, of shared interfaces. And let’s not get into all the different versions and variations.*
