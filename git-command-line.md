## Common tasks

Git is primarily a command line tool, here are a few commands that you’ll use regularly:

- `$ git init` To turn a folder into a Git repository
- `$ git status` Shows you what has changed in your repository
- `$ git difftool` Allows you to visually compare the changed files
- `$ git add` Adds a file to Git and readies it for committing
- `$ git commit -m "Your commit message."` Saves the current state of your files into Git’s history
- `$ git clone` Get a copy of a repository
- `$ git push` Send your commits to a remote repository
- `$ git pull` Get changes from a remote repository and merge them with your local copy
- `$ git rm` Delete a file from the repository
- `$ git checkout` Move backward and forward in history
- `$ git branch` Create a new, different version of the repository to add a new feature

*Most Git GUI tools have buttons that perform the same commands you’d execute with the Terminal.*
