Uniform resource locators are an extremely important part of the web—they’re how we address nearly everything.

## Why do URLs matter

The primary functionality of The Web is links and URLs.

- URLs are addresses that allow us to reference different locations and resources online
- Links are the basic functionality of every website—a simple way to navigate URLs

## Pieces of a URL

A URL is comprised of a few different pieces, mostly human readable:

```
scheme://hostname:port/path?query#fragment
```

- `scheme` — usually “http” or “https”, the communication method the computers use to speak with each other
- `hostname` — also known as the domain, the name given to a computer on the network
- `port` — can use to different ports for communication on the computers, the default port for websites is 80 for `http` and 443 for `https`
- `path` — the file that you’d like to see on the computer
- `query` — a query that allows the file to dynamically change
- `#fragment` — also known as the hash; where in that file you want to jump to, jumps down the page

*Each of these pieces should make sense to a human and should be adjustable—hackable—to change the web page that’s being viewed.*
