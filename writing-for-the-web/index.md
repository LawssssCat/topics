The words you choose for your design are equally—if not more—important than the colours and layout of your design. Without words your website isn’t understandable.

## Why designers need to craft words

There are many reasons that you need to be able to write: to craft the messages of your interface, to convey your ideas, to attract new clients and keep old clients, to tell stories and more.

### Design with text

To me, writing the content of a website is always the first thing I do. I open up a new [Markdown](/topics/markdown/) file and start writing out what content will be on the page, the headings, the paragraphs, the links, the buttons, etc.

Of course, no writing should be started without solid research and understanding of the project and the problem.

The words of your website and interface convey so much information about you, your product and your brand. They help people understand and use your product—and generally they’re more effective than icons. One word means much more than one icon.

## How people read on the web

**They don’t.** But they will, if they’re interested.

- People generally scan for important keywords
- Eye-tracking studies from 2008 show less than 20% of text is actually read
- People only read pages word by word if they are really interested

## Writing for the web

- The web is primarily text
- Highlight keywords, meaningful headings, bulleted lists
- The first paragraph or two must hold the most important information
- Start headings, paragraphs, and bullet points with information-carrying words; all other words will be skipped
- Inverted pyramid: conclusion at the top
- Half the word count
- Never use “Click here” because it conveys no information


    Be clear.
    Be kind.
    Be careful.
    Be honest.

Don’t assume you’re the core audience. Most of the time, we’re not designing for ourselves. Think about the universe of people out there. Word choice is extremely important when you’re trying to grow.

Avoid jargon and catchphrases. Cut the bullshit. You don’t have to be hip or clever, but you do have to be nice.

Don’t assume dichotomies or binaries will do the trick. Not everything will fit into a boolean. Real life is complicated. As an example, some people are neither male nor female. They’re still people and they deserve our consideration.

Don’t interrupt. Keep things focused and make sure this is the best time to deliver this message.

Don’t be a robot.


Wordsmith, iterate.
Write to your friend.
Read it out loud.

Use the words normal people use.

### Adaptive content

- Writing modular content for different locations: website, Twitter, Facebook, Google

### Creating a connection

- People connect with wit, emotion, personality, story telling
- What connection are you trying to convey with the words? How do you want your users to feel?
