The web is about open information for all human beingsâ€”so we need to test in as many browsers and platforms as possible.

## What to look for when testing



### Some things to look for:

- Any major, breaking differences in a specific browser?
- Is any of the functionality broken?
- Are there any weird inconsistencies?
- Do the layouts work on all screen sizes?
- Does it scale properly to fit the device?
- Does it work in portrait, landscape, fullscreen?
- Does the layout always fill the screen?
- Does it work with and without Images? CSS?
- Does it work when the font size is increased? Decreased?
- Does it work on different operating systems? In different browsers?
