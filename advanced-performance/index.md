## Content delivery networks

Content delivery networks (CDNs) allow us to distribute our resources around the world on lots of different servers. Then when a user downloads our website they receive the file from the server that’s closest to them making it download more quickly.

Most often we put our static files on CDNs, primarily images, because they’re the files that most benefit from CDNs.

### CloudFlare

CloudFlare is a very popular CDN with lots of great free features. But not only do they provide CDN features—automatically—they also perform other performance tasks: like minification, caching headers, gzipping and more.

[CloudFlare becomes our DNS provider](https://github.com/algonquindesign/resources/tree/master/domains#better-security-and-performance-with-cloudflare) and these options are fairly automatic after setting up.

They even provide a bunch of security features like DDOS protection and free SSL for websites.

*If you’re hosting on GitHub you’ll have to use a [custom domain](https://github.com/algonquindesign/resources/tree/master/domains) in order to take advantage of CloudFlare.*
