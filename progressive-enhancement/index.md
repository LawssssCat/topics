It’s our job, as web designers and developers, to accommodate as many possible uncertainties and allow our content to be consumed by anybody, anywhere, anytime.

## It’s about everybody

Since the web is open and available to every human being, throughout the world, there are a many uncertainties we have to understand and accommodate. The only thing we can be certain about is that the content will be consumed—beyond that we know very little.

### Your user is not you

> The power of The Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.

> — Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web

Don’t assume everybody has a large resolution monitor. Don’t assume everybody has a super-fast–always-on internet connection. Don’t assume everybody can *see* your design. Don’t assume everybody can tell the difference between red and green. And don’t assume that your content will be consumed just on your website.

There is very little we know about our users and a lot we don’t know:

- We don’t know where in the world our users are coming from;
- We don’t know what time of day our users will consume our content;
- We don’t know what format or context our content will be consumed in;
- We don’t know what devices our users are using;
- We don’t know our users’ browser window size;
- We don’t know our users’ internet connection speed;
- We don’t know the mindset of our users;
- And we don’t know what abilities our users have.

(From: [CSS-Tricks: What We Don’t Know](http://css-tricks.com/14664-what-we-dont-know/).)

All we know is that our users are human (unless they’re robots.)

Your users are not you. The Open Web opens so many doors for every human being. It’s our job as web designers to empower humans by helping them easily consume our website’s content—independent of their abilities, independent of their computer’s abilities, and often independent of the original source: our website.

**We can control all situations but we need to try to make our website functional for as many people as possible.**

### Checklist of what ifs

Here’s a big checklist of things to consider when developing your website. These things could happen for many different reasons, often not the user’s choice.

- ❏ What if the images don’t download or aren’t visible?
- ❏ What if the images are black & white?
- ❏ What if the font-size is significantly larger? Or smaller?
- ❏ What if CSS is disabled or doesn’t load?
- ❏ What if the browser doesn’t support newer CSS features?
- ❏ What if the browser doesn’t support newer HTML features?
- ❏ What if the browser is small? Or bigger?
- ❏ What if Javascript is disabled?
- ❏ What if there’s a Javascript error and it doesn’t run?
- ❏ What if the Internet connection is slow?
- ❏ What if your user isn’t giving their full attention?
- ❏ What if there is double the amount of content on the page?
- ❏ What if your content is consumed on another website?
