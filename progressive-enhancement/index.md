It’s our job, as web designers and developers, to accommodate as many possible uncertainties and allow our content to be consumed by anybody, anywhere, anytime.

## Progressive enhancement is about everybody

Since the web is open and available to every human being, throughout the world, there are a many uncertainties we, as web designers, have to understand and accommodate. The only thing we can be certain about, with our websites, is that the content will be consumed—beyond that we know very little.

### Checklist of what ifs

Here’s a big checklist of things to consider when developing your website. These things could happen for many different reasons, often not the user’s choice.

- ❏ What if the images don’t download or aren’t visible?
- ❏ What if the images are black & white?
- ❏ What if the font-size is significantly larger? Or smaller?
- ❏ What if CSS is disabled or doesn’t load?
- ❏ What if the browser doesn’t support newer CSS features?
- ❏ What if the browser doesn’t support newer HTML features?
- ❏ What if the browser is small? Or bigger?
- ❏ What if Javascript is disabled?
- ❏ What if there’s a Javascript error and it doesn’t run?
- ❏ What if the Internet connection is slow?
- ❏ What if your user isn’t giving their full attention?
- ❏ What if there is double the amount of content on the page?
- ❏ What if your content is consumed on another website?
