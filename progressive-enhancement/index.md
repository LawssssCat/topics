## Topics

**In your group, answer the topic questions, and present it to the class.**

### 1. What if the images don’t download or aren’t visible?

Disable images in your browser using the [Developer Toolbar](http://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/) and come up with solutions for your website. *Consider both foreground and background images.*

### 2. What if the font-size is significantly larger?

Use Safari’s “Zoom Text Only” option and bump *up* the font-size a couple times. This simulates the user changing their preferences to a larger font size.

### 3. What if there is double the amount of content on the page?

Look at different content modules on your website and consider what would happen if there was significantly more content. Maybe you gave control of all the text to your client with a CMS.

### 4. What if the browser doesn’t support newer CSS features?

Some CSS properties to consider:

- `@media`
- `linear-gradient()`
- `transition`
- `transform`
- `rgba()`
- `border-radius`

You can try out the [DeCSS3](http://davatron5000.github.io/deCSS3/) bookmarklet for a quick test.

### 5. What if the browser doesn’t support newer HTML features?

Some HTML properties to consider:

- `<details>`
- `<meter>`
- `<video>` & `<audio>`
- SVG

### 6. What if the internet connection is slow?

Use [Slowy App](http://slowyapp.com/) to test your website with a slow internet connection and come up with some ideas to mitigate the problems.

### 7. What if Javascript is disabled or doesn’t load?

Disable Javascript in your browser using the [Developer Toolbar](http://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/) and come up with solutions for your website.
